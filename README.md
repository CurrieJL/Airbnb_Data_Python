This analysis explores the profitability of entering the Austin market for Airbnb. I want to understand how much revenue is generated overall in the Austin area and how much competition exists. I also want to understand how different listings perform, if location is an important factor, and if revenue is consistent throughout the year. I use 1 year of Airbnb listing and booking data from 9/13/2024 through 9/13/2025. I will use the data to answer the following questions.
1. How much revenue was generated in the Austin Airbnb market during the 9/13/2024 through 9/13/2025 time period?
2. How many listings are in the Austin market?
3. What types of listings and how many of each?
4. What are the booking rates and revenue for each type of listing?
5. Where are the best places for a new listing and which type of listings perform well in that location?
6. Which areas have the most demand?
7. Which dates have the most demand for all listing types?
8. Which dates have the most demand per listing type?

Note: This analysis script can be converted to run as a function with the necessary outputs saved as files or added to a report file or sent to database tables to catch the data. This would eliminate repetitive code blocks. The advantage of showing each section is for step-by-step presentations and script readability. The code for answering each question can be discussed as needed along with the answers to the business question. Another employee can view the values and calculations to be assured the outputs are correct.
The text blocks contain discussion of the analysis and also describe the code blocks. The code block descriptions are added so that readers who are interested in the code-based processes will have this information for reference.
